Data of main reuslts for "Genetic associations between circulating immune cells and periodontitis highlight the prospect of systemic immunoregulation in periodontal care" are encapsulated in a compressed file named "Data". This archive contains individual CSV files for each exposure-outcome pair, meticulously organized according to their respective datasets.
The current Mendelian randomization analysis encompasses a variety of exposures and outcomes. To streamline the presentation and avoid repetitive coding, only a subset of examples is displayed.
